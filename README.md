# Object_Tracking_YOLOv8

The following repo has been made compatible to run with not only TensorFlow but also with higher version of SKlearn which was not supported earlier. All these changes can be found in the repo: https://github.com/Dipankar1997161/deep_sort.git

## Dependencies
    Python >=3.8
    TensorFlow > 2.x
    Sklearn > 1.x

## Object Tracking
Object tracking is a computer vision application in which a program identifies things and then follows their motions in space or across various camera angles. Several objects can be recognized and tracked using object tracking. The location of a ball in a picture, for instance, could be tracked by a football recording studio.

In augmented reality, object tracking is an important computer vision technique used to estimate or forecast the locations and other pertinent details of moving objects in real time.

## Results
Two files are generated as results:

    1. Output Video with detections
    2. Frames with detections ( which will be utilized for further application )

## Thank you :))
